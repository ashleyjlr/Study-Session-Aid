# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).

## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData; [[What does ROYGBIV stand for? ::: red orange yellow green blue indigo violet]]

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has actually
been created
yet]].

[[ How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
::: 
a woodchuck could chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could or 700 pounds ]]

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form: arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];

- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be 
a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable 
once instantiated.]]
